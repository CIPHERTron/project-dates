## Documentation Notes


- ### Apollo Client Error Handling
    > The errors would be thrown only at places where resolving happens, as the validation checks are happening at the resolver level.  
    > There are two possible places where resolving happens:  
    > 1. Query Resolver  
    > 2. Field Resolver
